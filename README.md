## Data Storage and Security

We are committed to the security of your highly sensitive financial information. We employ several industry-standard security measures to protect your data across all stages:

### A. Data Encryption

**Encryption In Transit (Data moving off-device):**

Any data transferred between your mobile device and our third-party service providers (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Google AdMob) is protected using **Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) encryption**. This ensures the data is encrypted and unreadable by unauthorized parties during transmission.

**Encryption At Rest (Data stored on-device):**

Your primary financial data (Transaction Data, Budget Information, etc.) stored locally on your device is protected using **device-level encryption** methods provided by the Android Operating System, leveraging technologies such as the **Android Keystore System**. This encrypts sensitive data at rest to protect it from unauthorized access if the device is lost or compromised.

### B. Local and Cloud Storage Practices

**Primary Storage:**

All your core financial records are stored **locally and exclusively on your device**. By default, this data is NOT transferred to any ZEXO Ledger server.

**User Control & Optional Cloud Backup:**

You may optionally initiate a manual backup of your data to YOUR personal Google Drive account via the Google Drive API. These backup files are stored in your private cloud storage, and we do not retain keys or access to this stored data outside of the user-initiated backup/restore process.

### C. Security Measures

- **Access Control**: User authentication via Firebase Authentication is required for all access and operations within the app
- **Fraud Prevention**: We use standard tools to monitor for and prevent fraudulent activity and security threats against the integrity of your data
- **Secure Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication support for enhanced account protection
- **Regular Security Audits**: Periodic security reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities
- **Secure Development Practices**: Following industry-standard secure coding guidelines

### D. Data Breach Notification

In the unlikely event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will:
- Notify you within 72 hours of discovering the breach
- Provide detailed information about what data was affected
- Outline steps you should take to protect yourself
- Report the breach to relevant authorities as required by law
